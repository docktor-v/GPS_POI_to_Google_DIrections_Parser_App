POI: Points of Interest

This windows based JavaFX application is intended to convert a simple .csv POI file into a searchable table, and then allow the user to select the elements of the table. Once an element (individual POI) is selected, a hyperlink is generated which gives directions to the POI from your current location to the POI location.

A sample table of data is included. 

Look at the Sample data file to understand how to format your data. It should be very similar to the sample.
