POI: Points of Interest

This app will take a simple .csv POI file which is parsed into a table. Included is a search bar to search within the table. Values in the table are selectable. Once selected, a link will activate which will give you directions to the point selected, from your current location, to the GPS coordinates of the selected point. 
A sample table of data is included. 

Look at the Sample data file to understand how to format your data. It should be very similar to the sample.
