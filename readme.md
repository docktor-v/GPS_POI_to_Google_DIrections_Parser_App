POI: Points of Interest

This app will take a simple .csv POI file which is parsed into a table. Included is a search bar to search within the table. Values in the table are selectable. Once selected, a link will activate which will give you directions to the point selected, from your current location, to the GPS coordinates of the selected point. 
A sample table of data is included. 

The CSV file should look as follows:

Latitude,Longittude,Company Name,City
40.626743,-103.217026,Sterling  CO  USA
40.490429,-106.842384,Steamboat Springs  CO  USA
38.025131,-107.67588,Ouray  CO  USA
39.247478,-106.300194,Leadville  CO  USA
